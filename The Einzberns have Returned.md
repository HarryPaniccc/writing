>Maybe put a short ominous prelude here.

Sirkonos had been too quiet for too long. His mom told Gunter that the sheriff's men were expected back with their outriders any day now, that the kingdom had just been holding its breath, but Gunter thought that it must have passed out by now — its boots stolen and coin purse left an empty sack at the side of the road, ignored by passerbys with upturned noses. No one cared for Sirkonos anymore. At least Gunter didn't.

>I suspect more descriptions of surroundings around here will fit. The fireflies is a big jump

He could barely make out the sound of the marsh frogs as he walked through the cobbled stone streets of Novest. Besides fireflies, the small alleys of his home town were never crowded after the sun went down. People wanted to avoid the solitude. This was not the kind one sought out for quiet reminiscence. This was the solitude felt by a lamb before it was taken by the wolves. Gunter knew well to avoid it. It just reminded him about what was happening around the kingdom. Disappearances in Diredahl. Rioting in Keldmire. And no one had ridden from Leerehalt in a year. None of that could touch tonight though.

Tonight was fight night. And it reminded Gunter that he was alive.

Walking past wooden townhouses, he listened for the signs of the evening's events. As always the sounds of carousing and jeering could be heard from down the road coming from a two-storied inn, but the strange sight of a nearly empty bar greeted him as he made his way through the front doors. He nodded to the barkeeper who had drawn the short straw for that month, made his way through the empty tables, and pushed his way down what his father would have called a secret staircase, but what was now the worst kept secret club this side of the Eastern Wastes.

>[!Note]
>Barkeeper sentence has to change

It was not long before he was eagerly squeezing his way through a crowded, merry room. In the dim candle light of the shell of a cellar-turned-fighting ring, polished mugs of beer were passed around and silver pieces were exchanged for the evening's bets. From a hundred different conversations the echoes of compliments, boasts and laughter became muddled with the sounds of a bard's viol against the dark wooden walls of the room. Smiles, actual smiles, shone from the faces of men and women who had been forced to give up their trades, go days without meals, or bury loved ones in the past months.

Here, Gunter thought as he peered through the waists of his countrymen, life finally returned to the kingdom. Here, there was a Sirkonos worth fighting for, not just pathways ladened with corpses stretching between the dying roots of civilization. There were no Kronesguard to protect you from the ghouls that wandered the night here in Novest. No temples to ward off the hauntings, and certainly no hunters to profit off of the sheriff's latest bounties. Despite the low stone wall and the sturdy archer towers surrounding it, his home was as unprotected as the rest of the kingdom, and though he would never admit it, that frustrated Gunter. The wolves had already made lambs of three good men in the last two months. No one knew if they would be the next one lost to the night. And, despite the smiles and the drinks and the music, that tension and fear of what stalked the night hung over the basement full of tradesmen like a guillotine ready to fall.

But that was why they met. What they lacked in safety, the good people of Novest made up for in spite. If they were going to be helpless, the least they could do is be helpless and entertained.

An hour into Gunter's mugs and passing between various different groups, bar hands began to clear a space in the center of the room. Some of the guests even eagerly offered their help. The carpet was rolled away to reveal deeply packed sand, stained brown and black.

The bouts began. The sound of fist-on-flesh was lost amidst the shouts from the onlookers. The first fights of the evening were to warmup the crowd, and Gaelen said it was good luck to wet the sand before the larger fights. Gunter always paid close attention to these, despite their low stakes. He had made a whole mint by keeping his eyes on the promising newcomers. It had been a shame when Gaelen had been found in a ditch with a hole in his stomach the previous month...

The sound of a body hitting the ground shook Gunter from his stupor. The cheers that followed banished the feeling in his gut. The loss of Gaelen was still fresh in Gunter's mind, and Gaelen was a fine boxer, but new to town and not that wise. So what if he went out alone? There were other youths looking to test their metal in the ring and keep those who remained cheering a while longer.

Silver was passed around as cold water was washed over the victor of the last fight, and Gunter pocketed a few pieces as the loser was seen to by the town's surgeon in case of any real injury. As conversation threatened to steal the crowd from his grasp, the ringmaster, Roahn, tightened his grip and announced the next bout.

"There it is friends," Roahn called to the crowd. "I would not have bet on such a grudge match between two seasoned fighters, but when a traveler hailing all the way from Pyleas tells you he wishes to test his mettle against an up-and-coming, you do not ignore him, _especially_ when he is built like that!"

The crowd replied with a roar that was quelled by a raise of the ringmaster's spindly hand.

"I am glad you see it as enthusiastically as I do! That being said, as fun as surprises are, I would wager that most of you are here for a different event."

---

As Roahn stoked the crowd, two men found their feet at the edge of the room. The older of the two — the Bull, the club members called him — was as wide as two men and had the strength of three. People often said that the mason's son had learned to _eat_ the stone he worked with, and that was what had given him his undefeated run in the ring. No matter who faced him, and no matter how many times that nose had been broken, he simply never went down.

Roahn announced his opponent first which gave the Bull a moment to analyze what he would be facing. He liked to think his victories were in part due to his opponents thinking him dull, but his short stint under the previous sheriff taught him that sizing his enemy up was half of any fight.

The younger man was shorter than him, with shorter reach and uncut black, dusty hair that reached just below his chin. He had an air of dirtiness about him, and the Bull would have thought him a beggar if his body was not cut from steel and sewn with scars. Twice before he had seen this boy fight. He was scrappy, but the men he struck usually did not want to stand up again. Personal hygiene aside — the boy even used too much chalk on his hands — the Bull was hoping for an attrition tonight, especially after the melees he had watched so far. There was enough blood on the ground to turn the sand nearly to mud. He could even taste iron on the air.

>[!Note]
>Use the opportunity to introduce Roahn more than just his hair colour

The brown haired ringmaster did well in introducing the younger man. He was from Keldmire, the walled city South West of Mount Ethris in the middle of Sirkonos. The word out of Keldmire recently had been tales of horror. Gangs seizing the city, the previous lords and sheriff being put to death, and the Kronesguard not doing a thing about it. It was likely the Bull's opponent was a deserter, unwilling to sit by wearing the mark of the King's justice on your shoulder all the while doing nothing as monsters seized your home. Desertion was an executable offense, the Kronesguard is a tightly run military, but the Bull could respect a man willing to abandon a path of false ideals and try to find his own way in a world run by blind men.

He waited as Roahn fed the crowd what he could to draw every eye in the room. A silence formed where there was once chatter from those disinterested in fights other than the main event, and the Bull drank in that silence. It felt lately that the only time he could think was while the crowd was being worked up. There was a clarity in the moment before stepping before his neighbours, before he stopped being Bhuren the stonemason and became the Bull of Novest. The crowds' eyes will belong to him in a minute, but for now, he was the one looking at them.

He saw the crowd before him, and in the dim candlelight, Bhuren saw what was missing. The gaps in the sea of hair, the empty seats at the corner tables. Even the makeshift bar was no longer full as it had been merely a year ago. He had lost friends and cousins on nights like these, while he had been entertaining and been entertained. He didn't feel guilty about it though, he just wished he could do more for this town than take their minds off of their troubles. It was like telling a joke to a man with an arrow in his gut. People were dying, but sometimes the best you could do was all they needed.

Roahn finished announcing the Bull's opponent, and the lad had begun dancing from one foot to the next. He was clearly anxious about the fight, constantly glancing to the crowd. He seemed to be making a point of not moving his hair from his face though. That didn't mean he would be underestimated. Sometimes fear is all it takes to bring out the real killer within someone.

As the ringmaster began to announce the arrival of the champion, the Bull made his way towards the center of the room. Slowly the crowd parted before him like a vast gate being opened. A pathway to the bloody sandpit ahead seemed to grow with each step the Bull took. Roahn's voice, straining to be heard, became lost in the swell of anticipation from the crowd and the buzz that grew to meet it within the Bull's head. He flexed his fingers and made fists, chalk trailing behind him. He cracked his neck, more for the crowd than for himself, and stretched his shoulders showing his bear chested bulk to his youthful opponent. He planted himself in the ring, boots dug into the pulp of blood and sand, arms raised to the sides of his head, and a broken-toothed grin spread across his face. His friends could forget their troubles for a while longer. He had work to do. The younger opponent mirrored his stance, the excess of chalk making his hands white and falling to the ground in flakes like winter snow.

They began.

The stone streets stretched around the old wooden buildings of the town square like cracks on a dry elbow. The lantern Toren carried to illuminate the late spring night attracted a handful of marsh fireflies as he walked his rounds. Every few minutes he passed by another guard wearing ununiformed gambeson and holding one of the spears that were shared among the sheriff's men. Toren was allowed to wear his father's sidesword, but had never drawn it with the intent of using it. That was how its previous owner had died, and Toren liked to think himself wiser than that.

Toren hated guard duty. When he was a boy he always imagined it to be glamorous. Holding a spear against the darkness beyond the walls, daring whatever prowled the marshes surrounding Novest to try and take what he protected. Like the heroes of the stories he had listened to growing up. Legends like the Einzbern monster hunters with their blades of sunlight, the Renslayer atop his dragon battling the enemies of the kingdom, and the warrior dwarves of Steinwalde. Now Toren knew the truth. There was no glory waiting for him out in the darkness. Just a death indifferent to everything about him but the meat on his bones.

He completed his round for the hour and returned to the square where the rest of the guards had gathered. Though they were not permitted to join in on the fighting club while on duty, it helped that the sounds of people could be heard from a good hundred feet away from the inn. Toren checked in on the other guardsmen who were delaying their patrols or betting on a hand of cards. He took a drink from the water barrel, chatting with pretty girl who had come to deliver the group some warm stew, and did his best not to pay any mind to the dark building at the end of the road.

Every town in Sirkonos had a ghost house or an ancient barrow from which legends emerged, but few were actually haunted, and fewer still were young enough that people knew what the buildings were actually used for before they became folklore. The dark townhouse at the end of the main road of Novest was one of those few cases. A few months ago the remains of the Taurig family had been found after the sheriff had ordered the door knocked down. The night before, the neighbours had heard what they had called the sounds of someone butchering an animal, but had thought nothing of it until the scent of decay had spread along the street by the noon sun. Toren didn't have the displeasure of seeing the remains, but he knew the men who did, and they almost burned the building down. Some of them still think they should.

>[!Note]
>Edit the paragraph below I think. "Thats not the worst of it" is kinda lame

The worst part of it was why Toren was so weary of the house. While on guard later in the week, he had seen the Taurig daughter — Selene was her name — walk down the road and into the marsh, apparently completely healthy, despite having reportedly had most of her organs removed. The two voices within him disagreed that night. The wisdom that kept his sidesword sheathed had told him to ignore it and live another day. The hopeful child that he used to be called him a coward.

After three sets of guards had joined and left the courtyard it was time for Toren to begin his next round. He banished the thoughts of ghost stories and pointedly made his way in the direction away from the Taurig residence, lantern held ahead of him so that he could find his way, despite the familiarity of the streets. The silence that accompanied him did not do anything to help calm his nerves. Everyone in Novest knew not to go out alone unarmed after the sun set, and his spear gave him little reassurance as he walked between buildings abandoned for the evening's brawls.

A scream did not pierce the night. Blood had not been sprayed across the walls of the alleyways he passed. Men Toren grew up with did not die painful and cruel deaths. And yet he was afraid. Every shadow threatened to be a hag of the marshes, come to drown him in mud and the weight of his regrets. Every noise in the distance was a shade hungering for his soul and for vengeance for disturbing their rest. Each stick in the road was a spear, abandoned by one of his fallen comrades as they were stolen by the night...

Wait, that _is_ a spear lying in that alleyway.

Roahn was a man of realities. He did not believe in stories and he did not believe in luck. He believed in things he could touch and count, and of the things that he believed in, Roahn believed most deeply in silver.

Opportunity presented itself everywhere, even in backwater, forgotten tradesman towns like Novest. One merely needed an eye for spotting opportunities that aligned with one's skillset. And what Roahn was good at, was manipulating attention.

For over a year now Roahn had operated Novest's fight club from the renovated basement of his family's inn. His father had been an honest barman, tipping his hat to the traders and travelers that passed through Novest by way of beds he owned, but Roahn had never been content with a life of serving wealthier men. Roahn believed he was meant for something more. Roahn believed in silver.

And then the kingdom had started to die. The travelling tradesmen and men at arms had stopped tipping their hats back to him and his serving staff. Business had stopped coming in because the prices of his mead and beer were simply no longer reasonable to people who could not even put food on the table. The people of his hometown now spent all their days thinking about how bad life had gotten and how little they had. They had no time to waste feeding their appetites for finery. 

So he turned their attention elsewhere.

The fight club had given people something to believe in, a distraction, and had brought money flowing not only into Roahn's coffers from the pockets of Novest's good people, but into Novest from those who had heard about the 'secret' fighting club beneath the town's inn. Farmhands from neighboring villages would take a week away with some of their savings to try and make a small profit betting, or even fighting, and then most of their wealth would funnel its way back towards the the ringleader. Travelling merchants had a regular meeting in which they could peddle their goods, so long as the host of the evening's events was allowed a fair discount, and first go at the stock of course. Things could not have been going better for Roahn. He felt as though he had finally found his place, as ringmaster of Novest, and its wealthiest citizen by far.

He thought this as he watched his main event with a pit in his stomach. The fight was the best any of the regulars had ever seen, a complete grudge match between two highly capable fighters — The Bull's might pitted against the untamed ferocity of a breakout star from halfway across the kingdom. The crowd was aflame with each strike the contestants landed. The challenger landing a solid cross and resetting out of reach in the time it took The Bull to wind up and miss a haymaker. The Bull then set his feet and feinted expertly with another build up, only to catch the premature shift in the younger man's stance with a jab from his closer left hand, surprising his opponent, and putting him off balance long enough to award him with a hook to the side.

The two reset as the champion spat blood and the challenger wiped a stream of it from his brow, both spilling more onto the already mud-like surface of the once dry sand below. The younger fighter actually _smiled_, and beckoned the Bull onwards with his leading hand. 

None of the previous challengers had been able to survive more than a single direct strike to the jaw from the stonemason, yet the man who urged The Bull onwards in the ring this night had taken _four_ in his stride, and showed no sign of slowing down despite the bruises that now decorated his body.

Who was he? The question had ruined Roahn's confidence in his control over his situation. This man, who had paid Roahn quadruple the entry fee to take on some of his best fighters, and now stood unfazed by the strongest man in Novest, was certainly no run of the mill deserter-turned-streetfighter. Everyone had been excited to watch a young challenger overstep his reach, drawing in a big bet for himself, and then losing it all when he foolishly bet against impossible odds. People liked a good narrative, especially when it made them rich.

But Gods... what if this kid actually _won_ tonight?

The pair clashed again, The Bull unleashing a tempest of fury as the challenger evaded what he could and absorbed the rest. Despite his size, The Bull could summon remarkably swift strikes, and, though for a moment the challenger appeared too slippery for him, eventually a blow had to be absorbed by a curled arm against his head. Then another strike to the ribs had to be blocked with a forearm. Dodge. Dodge. Block. Dodge. And then, finally, CRACK, a boulder of a fist found an unguarded cheek.

The crowd hushed as the strike reverberated through the room, and one could have _sworn_ there was smoke coming from the point at which contact was made. The Bull, breathless, wiped sweat from his brow, his knuckle sounding like sandpaper against his face as the audience held their breath.  The challenger lost his balance, and fell to his hands.

But after a few breaths, he dug his fist into the sand of the pit, and rose to his feet.

No, this was no mere deserter. Roahn watched as the challenger wiped his first bead of sweat from the side of his face. A strange, almost inky smear was left in its place, as though the boy was sweating oil. 

Both fighters had lost their smiles. What remained in the icy blue eyes of the challenger sent a shiver down Roahn's spine. Those were the eyes of a man who had killed before, and who looked as though he wanted to kill again.
